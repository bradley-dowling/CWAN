# Conversations with a Neuron
Some files for the *Conversations with a Neuron* website. By Bradley Dowling.

This repository holds some of the files for my *Conversations with a Neuron* website. 
The website is currently under construction and can be found [here](http://128.199.2.9/articles/).

**NOTE:** Not all of the files that make up *Conversations with a Neuron* are in this repository.
Be sure to check out my [Hodgkin-Huxley demo](https://bradley-dowling.github.io/temporalSummation/) 
as well my [Github repo](https://github.com/bradley-dowling/temporalSummation) for it.
